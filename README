This is a very preliminary attempt to create a syntax sugar for latex.  

What works:

basic headings (chapters, sections, subsections)
latex functions
comments

That's about it for the moment.  Please do add improvements.  I barely know what I am doing.

Also, you may want to add the following to your theme:

/* @group Latex */

latex.heading {
	color: #448C27;
		font-weight: bold;	
}

heading.latex{
	color: #448C27;
		font-weight:bold;	
		background: rgba(150, 0, 0, .08);	
}


function.latex {
	color: #666666;
	font-weight: bold;		
}



delimiter.latex {
	color: #333399;
}

/* @end */
